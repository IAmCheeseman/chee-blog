            <p>
                Red Nivis is a roguelike metroidvania where you explore the 
                ruins of the Red Nivis Laboratory. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-title">5 Unique Areas</h2>
            <p>
                There are 5 areas to explore: Lab, Deep Labs, Freezers, Chem 
                Sector, Tech Sector. All of these being unique and focused on a
                different way to change the gameplay. The Freezer's aquatic
                based enemies make you play differently than the poison based
                Chem Sector enemies.

            <p>
                There are tons of weapons for you to choose from. Weapons build
                off previous weapons and make them better and better while also
                making each iteration of the idea different from the last.
